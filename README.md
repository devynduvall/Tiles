# Wildfire Data Tiles

The examined geographic area for all of these tilesets is Washington State because that is where the wildfire data that I have collected was about.

## First Tile Set

Available zoom level: 8-11

This basemap uses the Galaxy Monochrome Basemap on Mapbox. I decided to use this basemap because of the color contrast of the dark background and the green forested areas.

I am very interested in Wildfires within Washington State and this data set is from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. All of these fires happened between 1971 and 2019 and they are all the major forest fires that have happened in the state.

This map is just a combination between the first basemap and the wildfire data.

This map is themed towards the Natural Landscapes around Seattle and Washington. The contrasting colors of the map are important for the viewer to be able to fully understand the purpose of this map. I also changed the color of hiking and biking trails to yellow to show the viewer of the map important information regarding hiking.
